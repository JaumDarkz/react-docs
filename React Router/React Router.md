# React Router

- The **React Router** is a package to change te URL's  of the Application;

- So we can access another views, **without the page reload**;

- **Channging only a part of the layout of the application**, that is, what changes from view to view;

- We need to **install the package** and set up for what we are going to develop;
```
yarn add react-router-dom
```
And for npm users: <p style='font-size: 9px'>-_-<p>
```
npm install react-router-dom
```
