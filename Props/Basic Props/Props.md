# Props

- The **props** are values passed to components;

- We can make them **dynamic** (Not Static constant values);

- That is, changing the execution because thr prop value;

- The value is passed as an attribute in the component call;

- And needs to be redeemed inside an poperty/argument called props in the function definition of the component;

- The props only reads! (we dont modify, we only use);

- Pro tip: we can use detructuring to clean the props props props repetition.
